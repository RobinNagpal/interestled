# interestled-deployer or interestled-api actually get, and still narrow enough
# that nothing created here can reach another product in this account.
#
# The `iam:*` deny is the point of the whole file: it is what stops a principal
# created by the infra user from creating principals of its own, which is the
# escalation path a boundary exists to close.
